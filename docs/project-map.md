# Water Utility Data Hub: project map

Verification results and limitations: [organization verification](organization-verification.md).

Latest presentation requirements and functional checks: [PowerPoint alignment review](integration-pptx-review.md).

Desktop interactions and verification limits: [Mercado Chrome review](browser-review.md).

The project root contains **frontend/** and **backend/** as independent npm workspaces. Run the documented npm commands from this root. This organization preserves the existing Next.js App Router, Express API, URLs, permissions, styles and database schema.

Frontend paths in this table are relative to `frontend/`; backend paths are relative to `backend/`. Screens use `<feature>.screen.tsx`. Feature-only editors, diagrams, definitions and types stay alongside their feature. Common controls and application navigation do not depend on a feature screen.

## Backend responsibilities

- `*.routes.ts`: route paths, permission guards, rate limits and controller binding.
- `*.controller.ts`: Express request/response handling, cookies, statuses and downloads. Controllers do not execute Prisma queries.
- `*.service.ts`: business workflows and orchestration, with transport-neutral inputs/context. Services retain transaction ownership and transaction-bound operations so audit writes and existing lock/version checks remain atomic.
- `*.repository.ts`: named user/session lookups, operational queries, quality snapshots, canonical adapters and reporting-query workflows. Small transaction-local queries remain inside services; no generic repository framework or forwarding-only classes were added.
- `*.schemas.ts`: feature validation. Canonical field validation is in `modules/canonical/canonical.schemas.ts`.
- `quality.rules.ts`, `quality.engine.ts` and `quality.samples.ts` : rule metadata, executable checks and readable sample formatting separate from HTTP handling.
- `shared/`: focused error, validation/pagination, identity/context, hashing/security, audit and CSV helpers, plus Manila date helpers.

Only files with a real responsibility exist; a module is not forced to contain an empty controller/repository/schema file.

## How a request reaches the database

For example, the Users screen calls `api('/users')` in the shared client. The browser requests `/api/users`. `frontend/next.config.ts` rewrites it to Express, where request protection and session middleware run before `backend/src/app.ts` mounts `/users`. The users route enforces the administrator guard, the controller collects input/context, and the service validates input and applies business rules. Named repository queries or the service-owned transaction use Prisma against the configured database. The controller returns the existing envelope, status and cookies. Errors reach `middleware/error-handler.ts`.

## Tooling and verification

- Root `scripts/dev/local-preview.ts`: local/demo process orchestration.
- Root `scripts/demo/walkthrough.ts`: finite local HTTP demonstration.
- Root `scripts/check-architecture.ts`: checks imports, dependency directions, runtime cycles, original API route paths/mounts and unchanged schema/migrations/CSS. It does not load environment files or contact a database.
- CI runs this architecture check. Intentional future API or styling changes require reviewing the corresponding baseline in `backend/tests/architecture/baseline.json`; historical migrations remain immutable.
- `backend/scripts/`: database setup, local PostgreSQL, test-cluster runner and maintenance utilities. These commands retain their loopback guards and root-relative ignored configuration.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:security`, and `npm run build` are the independent verification commands.

Ignored `.env` and `.local/local.env` remain at the project root. Never print or commit them. Database tests always use disposable local PostgreSQL. Organization did not change a schema, apply a remote migration, seed Neon, alter accounts or clean runtime data. Original source snapshots are privately retained in `.local/organization-original/`; they are not active source or an alternate runnable project. Historical verification documents may mention pre-organization `apps/web` and `apps/api` paths; this map describes the current locations.
